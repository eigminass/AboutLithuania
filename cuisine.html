                    Lithuanian cuisine features products suited to the cool and moist northern climate of Lithuania:
                    barley, potatoes, rye, beets, greens, berries, and mushrooms are locally grown, and dairy products
                    are one of its specialties. Various ways of pickling were used to preserve food for winter. Soups
                    are extremely popular, and are widely regarded as the key to good health. Since it shares its
                    climate and agricultural practices with Northern Europe, Lithuanian cuisine has much in common with
                    its Baltic neighbors and, in general, northern countries. Longlasting agricultural and foraging
                    traditions along with variety of influences during the country's long, difficult and interesting
                    history formed a Lithuanian cuisine.

                    German traditions have had an influence on Lithuanian cuisine, introducing pork and potato dishes,
                    such as potato pudding (kugelis or kugel) and intestines stuffed with mashed potato (vėdarai), as
                    well as the baroque tree cake known as Šakotis. Lithuanian noblemen usually hired French chefs -
                    French cuisine influence came to Lithuania in this way. The most exotic influence is Eastern
                    (Karaite) cuisine, and the dish kibinai which got popular in Lithuania. Lithuanians and other
                    nations which lived in Grand Duchy of Lithuania also share some dishes and beverages. Lithuanian
                    cuisine also influenced Polish and Ruthenian cuisines.

                    Despite the apparent richness of the cuisine, Lithuania has a very low prevalence of obesity. 8
                    Lithuanian restaurants are listed in White Guide Baltic Top 30.

                <h2>History of Lithuanian cuisine</h2>

                <p>
                    The earliest mentions of food and agriculture of the Baltic people (Aestii) and related customs
                    comes from Tacitus circa 98 AD: "they cultivate grain and other crops with a perseverance
                    unusual among the indolent Germans."

                    The 9th-century traveller Wulfstan attested usage of mead among West Balts: "There is a great
                    deal of honey and fishing. The king and the most powerful men drink mare's milk, the poor men
                    and the slaves drink mead. ... There is no ale brewed among the Este but there is plenty of
                    mead."

                    In 14th century Lithuania almost all today known cereals and legume were grown, but rye being
                    the most popular. In the hilfort of Maišiagala in the layer of 13-14 century about 20 sorts of
                    various cereals and legume were found - winter and summer rye, wheat, barley, oat, proso,
                    buckwheat, lentil, vetches, peas, broad beans.

                    In the Middle Ages, hunting was the main way to provide oneself with meat. It is known that
                    Vytautas The Great before the Battle of Žalgiris organized a big hunting in the Baltvyžis forest
                    and prepared barrels of salt-cured meat for the army. Game was also a staple of noblemen:
                    wisents, aurochs, and deer were hunted. Lithuania had a long lasting wars(about 200 years) with
                    Teutonic Order. It also kept diplomatic relationships with it, during which various presents
                    were exchanged - it is known what Teutonic Order sent a rare wine to Anna, Grand Duchess of
                    Lithuania, wife of Vytautas the Great, in 1416. At this time Lithuanian nobleman already
                    imported saffron, cinnamon, rice, pepper, raisins for their needs.

                    The Congress of Lutsk, hosted by Vytautas the Great, was another example of medieval Lithuanian
                    cuisine. Chronicles report that seven hundred barrels of honey, wine, 700 oxen, 1,400 sheep,
                    hundreds of elk, wild boar, and other dishes were consumed daily.

                    Traditional Lithuanian hunting and landscape, still existing conflicts between paganism and
                    Christianity was described by Nicolaus Hussovianus in his Latin poem Carmen de statura, feritate
                    ac venatione bisontis (A Song about the Appearance, Savagery and Hunting of the Bison, 1523).

                    Bona Sforza, Grand Duchess consort of Lithuania, introduced the fork and traditional Italian
                    food - olives, olive oil; made wine and wheat flour more popular. Parsnips, cauliflowers,
                    spinach and even artichokes were introduced and grown. It is assumed that Palace of the Grand
                    Dukes of Lithuania had their own kitchen garden. Daughter of Bona Sforza, Catherine Jagiellon
                    after marying John III of Sweden introduced the fork and other cultural habits to Sweden. In XVI
                    rulers and nobleman of Lithuania consumed grapes, oranges, melons, raspberries, strawberries,
                    cherries, and plums.

                    In the sale contract made in 1623 by Elisabeth Sophie von Brandenburg, wife of Jonušas Radvila
                    and Jonušas Kiška, she sold a garden in Vilnius. The text of the treaty has very detailed
                    mentionings of the garden plants such as grafted apple trees, pears, plums (prunus domestica),
                    cherries, wild cherries, vitis, hawthorns, dog roses. A garden for Italian vegetables (as they
                    called back then) is also very detailed. That is potatoes, artichokes, asparagus, lamb's
                    lettuce, rucola, garden cress, spinatch, melones, beets, rushes, French parsley, Italian onions,
                    lettuce, chicory. And spices and decorative shrubs: anise, peppermints, estragon, dill, true
                    indigo and junipers. Wooden orangerie is also mentioned which was used to grow fig-trees and
                    common walnuts.

                    The growing of potatoes in Lithuania is known from the 17th century, but it became more
                    widespread only in the 18th century.

                    Archeological finds at the place of the Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania revealed a lot of
                    information about the food eaten, cutlery and serving of the rulers of Lithuania.

                    First explorer of the Lithuanian flora, botanist Jurgis Pabrėža [lt] described spicery growing
                    in Lithuania.

                    During the past years, restaurants in Lithuania emerged which specialize in historic Lithuanian
                    cuisine, culinary heritage and its interpretations.

                <h2>Bread</h2>

                <p>
                    One of the oldest and most fundamental Lithuanian food products was and is rye bread. Rye bread is
                    eaten every day for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Bread played an important role in family rituals
                    and agrarian ceremonies. Traditionally, the centerpiece of Lithuanian cuisine is dark rye bread
                    (ruginė duona) which is used more often than light wheat breads. The archeological finds reveal that
                    bread in the 9th - 14th centuries in Lithuania was very similar to the current rye bread. The dough
                    is usually based on a sourdough starter, and includes some wheat flour to lighten the finished
                    product. Traditionally each home had its own sourdough yeast - raugas, which also had symbolical
                    meaning of the home. Rye bread is often eaten as an open-faced sandwich, buttered or spread with
                    cheese. It is sometimes flavored with caraway, or with some onion. Traditional bread is baked on
                    sweet flag leaves. Lithuanian proverb says - Be aukso apsieis, be duonos ne (One can manage without
                    gold, but not without bread).

                    Some varieties of Lithuanian bread contain whole seeds of rye and wheat; this type of bread is
                    referred to as grūdėtoji, i.e. "seeded" bread.

                <h2>Vegetables and Spices</h2>

                <p>
                    The most commonly used vegetable in Lithuanian recipes is the potato; in its simplest forms, it is
                    boiled, baked, or sauteed, often garnished with dill, but a tremendous[citation needed] variety of
                    potato recipes exist. Potatoes were introduced into Lithuania in the late 18th century, were found
                    to prosper in its climate, and soon became indispensable.

                    Cucumbers, dill pickles, radishes and greens are quite popular. Beets (burokai) are grown more
                    widely than in other areas of the world, and are often used for making borscht and side dishes.
                    Cabbage is another popular vegetable, used as a basis for soups, or wrapped around fillings
                    (balandėliai). Tomatoes are now available year-round in stores, but those home-grown in family
                    greenhouses are still considered superior.

                    Lithuanian herbs and seasonings include mustard seed, horseradish (krienai), dill (krapai), caraway
                    seed (kmynai), garlic, bay leaf, juniper berries (kadagio uogos), and fruit essences. Vanilla and
                    pepper were scarce during the Soviet occupation, but were welcomed back after independence. The
                    cuisine is relatively mild.

                    Pickling is a popular way to prepare vegetables for winter or just to give them particular flavour.
                    Cucumbers, beets, dills, home grown tomatoes, onions, garlics are pickled and available all year
                    round.

                <h2>Foraging: berries and mushrooms, edible wild plants</h2>

                <p>
                    One of the prides of Lithuanian cuisine is its wide use of wild berries and mushrooms and this
                    foraging tradition is pretty much alive to this day.

                    Mushrooming is a popular pastime from mid-summer to autumn. As a staple, mushrooms are usually
                    harvested in the forest; occasionally they are purchased at roadside markets, especially on the road
                    in the Dzūkija region from Druskininkai to Vilnius; the purchasing of mushrooms in shops is rare.
                    Despite its status as a delicacy, mushrooms are thought of by many Lithuanians as hard to digest.
                    Dried mushrooms being used as a seasoning. A number of mushroom species are harvested from the wild,
                    including:
                </p>

                <br>

                
                <ul id="mushroom-list">
                    <li>Baravykas - king bolete</li>
                    <li>Voveraitė (literally, little squirrel), lepeška (in Dzūkija region) – chanterelle</li>
                    <li>Gudukas, vokietukas, kalpokas, vištelė – gypsy mushroom</li>
                </ul>

                

                

                <br>

                <p>
                    Baravykas is the most valued and sought-after species; the primary usages are drying and marinating.
                    Dried baravykas has a strong pleasant scent and is used as seasoning in soups and sauces. Voveraitė
                    is often used fresh as a seasoning in soups or sauteed. Most common dish of this mushroom is
                    voveraitė sauteed with chopped bulb onions and potatoes. Gudukas, arguably the most locally abundant
                    of edible mushrooms due to its lower popularity, is usually marinated. Other edible mushrooms, such
                    as lepšė (Leccinum scabrum), raudonviršis or raudonikis (literally, "red-topped") (Leccinum
                    aurantiacum), makavykas (Suillus variegatus), šilbaravykis (Xerocomus badius), are more rare, but
                    are also gathered and may be used in the same ways as baravykas.

                    Wild berries are also gathered or, even more frequently than mushrooms, purchased at roadside
                    markets or shops. Bilberries (mėlynės) and lingonberries (bruknės) are the two most abundant species
                    of wild berries. Cranberries (spanguolės) are valued, but their cultivation is limited to certain
                    boggy areas, such as those adjacent to Čepkeliai Marsh. Sour cranberry or lingonberry jam and sweet
                    bilberry jam are all considered excellent sauces for pancakes (blynai). Lingonberry jam is
                    occasionally used as a dressing for fried chicken or turkey or as a sauce for other savory dishes.
                    Fresh bilberries may be put into a cold milk soup. Wild strawberries (žemuogės) are relatively
                    scarce and are usually gathered for immediate consumption.

                    Lithuanian-style cakes (pyragas) are often baked in a rectangular pan and sometimes have apple,
                    plum, apricot, or other fruit baked in; they are less frequently iced than is customary in the
                    United States. These cakes are cut into squares for serving. Poppy seed is sometimes used as a swirl
                    filling in dessert bread (Poppy seed roll and šimtalapis) and as a flavoring in other pastries.

                    For special occasions, torte may be prepared; they often consist of 10 to 20 layers, filled with jam
                    and vanilla, chocolate, mocha, or rum buttercreams; they are lavishly decorated. Lithuanian
                    coffeehouses (kavinė) serve a variety of tortes and pastries to attract evening strollers.

                    Desserts include:

                    Žagarėliai (also known as krustai or chrustai) - Twisted, thin deep-fried pastries dusted with
                    powdered sugar; identical to Scandinavian Klejner cookies, similar to Mexican buñuelo.
                    Kūčiukai or šližikai - very small rolls are baked and served with poppyseed milk; this is a
                    traditional Kūčios' (Christmas Eve) dish.
                    Ledai - ice cream is served everywhere in the summer.
                    Spurgos - a Lithuanian variant of doughnuts, sometimes filled with preserves. Main difference from
                    doughnuts or berliners is that the Lithuanian version uses curd as a basis. Therefore, they often
                    called varškės spurgos - curd doughnuts.
                    Šakotis (also called raguotis) - is essentially a pound cake grilled layer by layer, with a very
                    distinctive branching form. It is a Lithuanian variant of a spit cake which is a distant cousin of
                    the German Baumkuchen, the French gâteau à la broche, the Swedish spättekaka. Some sources attribute
                    its invention to Yotvingians - ancient, now extinct Baltic tribe. Šakotis is a frequent accent of
                    Lithuanian weddings and bigger festivities.
                    Šimtalapis (one hundred sheets) - introduced to Lithuania with Tatars brought by Vytautas the Great
                    and modified locally, is made from laminated dough which is separated with layer of melted butter -
                    the principle is very similar to that of croissant.

                <h2>Beer</h2>

                <p>
                    Alus (beer) is extremely popular throughout the country, especially again since the restoration of
                    the Independence in 1990. Several Lithuanian beers have won international awards. Local breweries
                    are enjoying a renaissance. Beer is the most common alcoholic beverage. Lithuania has a long
                    farmhouse beer tradition, first mentioned in 11th-century chronicles. Beer was brewed for ancient
                    Baltic festivities and rituals. Ancient Lithuanian god for brewing beer and mead was Ragutis or
                    Rūgutis. Lithuania is not very well known for its beer worldwide, but it is one of the few countries
                    in Europe to have an independent beer tradition in which breweries do not simply brew beers in
                    styles developed elsewhere. Traditional farmhouse brewing has survived into the present day in
                    Lithuania, and during Soviet times such brewing started to be expanded to a larger scale. After
                    independence, this process gathered speed and soon there were more than 200 breweries in the
                    country. Many of these have since gone out of business, but Lithuania still has about 80 breweries,
                    of which perhaps 60-70 produce beers in styles unknown in the rest of the world. Some of these are
                    very close to the traditional brews made by farmers, while others have developed out of that
                    tradition as a consequence of the growth of the traditional brewers into reasonably large regional
                    breweries.

                    Farmhouse brewing survived to a greater extent in Lithuania than anywhere else, and through
                    accidents of history the Lithuanians then developed a commercial brewing culture from their unique
                    farmhouse traditions. Lithuania is top 5 by consumption of beer per capita in Europe in 2015,
                    counting 75 active breweries, 32 of them are microbreweries.

                    The microbrewery scene in Lithuania has been growing in later years, with a number of bars focusing
                    on these beers popping up in Vilnius and also in other parts of the country. Local beers have
                    started to attract international attention after beer bloggers discovered the country, inspiring a
                    major feature article in Beer Connoisseur magazine, prompting the New York Times to list Lithuania
                    as one of the 42 places to visit in 2013 on the strength of the village beers. Beer routes are
                    organized through the main breweries in northern Lithuania.

                <h2>Midus</h2>

                <p>
                    Midus is said to be the most ancient Lithuanian alcoholic beverage; it is a variety of mead made
                    from honey. Balts were making midus for thousands of years. One of the first mentionings of Balts
                    and mead was by the 9th-century traveller Wulfstan of Hedeby, who visited Prussians. Old Lithuanian
                    mead was made from a solution of honey and water simmered with various spices, such as thyme, lemon,
                    cinnamon, cherries, linden blossoms, juniper berries, and hops. Oldest recipe of Lithuanian midus
                    was recorded in a book by Olaus Magnus Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus, published in Rome in
                    1555. Midus was considered a drink of nobleman and gentry. Since 16th century midus started to
                    compete with imported vine, but it was known and was still very popular in Palace of the Grand Dukes
                    of Lithuania. Today Midus is produced by several companies and is to be found in majority of liquor
                    shops. Craft mead producing is also becoming popular. Traditional Lithuanian midus Stakliškės,
                    fermented up to 90 days has a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) label.
