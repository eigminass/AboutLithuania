                        <p>
                            Lithuania is the southest country of the three baltic
                            states with the population of 2.848 million people.
                            Since 2004 Lithuania belongs to European union as well
                            as NATO and since 2015 national currency of the country
                            is euro. Lithuania has 4 ethnographic regions: Samogitia, Aukštaitija, Sudovia, Dzūkija and
                            each of these regions shares unique culture.

                                Lithuania can be divided into historical and cultural regions (called ethnographic
                                regions).
                                The exact borders are not fully clear, as the regions are not official political or
                                administrative units. They are delimited by culture, such as country traditions,
                                traditional lifestyle, songs, tales, etc. To some extent regions correspond to the zones
                                of Lithuanian language dialects. This correspondence, however, is by no means strict.
                                For example, although the Dzūkian dialect is called South Aukštaitian, it does not mean
                                that Dzūkija is part of Aukštaitija. In certain parts of some regions, dialects of other
                                regions are spoken, while for example
                                in Samogitia, there are three indigenous dialects (southern, northern and western
                                Samogitian), some of which are subdivided into subdialects.

                        <h2>Basketball and Lithuania</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Lithuania men's national basketball team (Lithuanian: Lietuvos nacionalinė vyrų
                            krepšinio rinktinė) represents Lithuania in international basketball competitions. They are
                            controlled by the Lithuanian Basketball Federation, the governing body for basketball in
                            Lithuania. Despite Lithuania's small size, with a population of less than 3 million, the
                            country's devotion to basketball has made them a traditional force of the sport in Europe.

                            The Lithuanian national team won the last EuroBasket tournaments prior to World War II, in
                            1937 and 1939. The 1939 team was led by Frank Lubin, who helped popularize basketball in the
                            country and was called the "grandfather of Lithuanian basketball". Following the country's
                            annexation by the Soviet Union during the war, Lithuanian players frequently formed the core
                            of the Soviet national team. The most prevalent example was the 1988 Olympic basketball gold
                            medal-winning team, which got most of its scoring from four Lithuanians: Valdemaras
                            Chomičius, Rimas Kurtinaitis, Šarūnas Marčiulionis and Arvydas Sabonis.

                            After the restoration of Lithuanian independence in 1990, the national team was resurrected.
                            Lithuania won bronze medals at the first three Summer Olympics to include NBA players –
                            1992, 1996, and 2000 - in addition to finishing fourth in 2004 and 2008, and in eighth place
                            in 2012. The Lithuanian national team won the EuroBasket for the third time in 2003, and
                            also a bronze medal at the 2010 FIBA World Cup.

                            <h2>Lithuanian Climate</h2>
                            <p>
                                Lithuania has a humid continental climate (Dfb in the Köppen climate classification).
                                Average temperatures on the coast are −2.5 °C (27.5 °F) in January and 16 °C (60.8 °F)
                                in July. In Vilnius the average temperatures are −6 °C (21.2 °F) in January and 16 °C
                                (60.8 °F) in July. Simply speaking, 20 °C (68 °F) is frequent on summer days and 14 °C
                                (57.2 °F) at night. Temperatures occasionally reach 30 or 35 °C (86 or 95 °F) in summer.
                                Winters when easterly flows from Siberia predominate, like 1941–42, 1955–56 and 1984–85,
                                are very cold, whereas winters dominated by westerly maritime airflows like 1924–25,
                                1960–61 and 1988–89 are mild with temperatures above freezing a normal occurrence. −20
                                °C or −4 °F occurs almost every winter. Winter extremes are −34 °C (−29 °F) at the coast
                                and −43 °C (−45 °F) in the east of Lithuania. The average annual precipitation is 800
                                millimetres (31.5 in) on the coast, 900 mm (35.4 in) in Samogitia highlands and 600 mm
                                (23.6 in) in the eastern part of the country. Snow occurs every year, it can be snowing
                                from October to April. In some years sleet can fall in September or May. The growing
                                season lasts 202 days in the western part of the country and 169 days in the eastern
                                part. Severe storms are rare in the eastern part of Lithuania and common nearer the
                                coast.

                                The longest measured temperature records from the Baltic area cover about 250 years. The
                                data show that there were warm periods during the latter half of the eighteenth century,
                                and that the nineteenth century was a relatively cool period. An early twentieth century
                                warming culminated in the 1930s, followed by a smaller cooling that lasted until the
                                1960s. A warming trend has persisted since then.

                                Lithuania experienced a drought in 2002, causing forest and peat bog fires. The country
                                suffered along with the rest of Northwestern Europe during a heat wave in the summer of
                                2006.
