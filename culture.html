                <h2>Culture of Lithuania</h2>

                <p>
                    The culture of Lithuania combines an indigenous heritage, represented by the unique Lithuanian
                    language, with Nordic cultural aspects and Christian traditions resulting from historical ties with
                    Poland. Although linguistic resemblances represent strong cultural ties with Latvia in various
                    historical moments Lithuania was influenced by Nordic, Germanic and Slavic cultures. Various
                    cultural changes occurred throughout Lithuania's transformation from a country occupied by the
                    Soviet Union to an independent Baltic state.

                <h2>Ethnicity and nationality</h2>


                <p>
                    Lithuania has the most homogeneous population in the Baltic states. In the 2001 census, 83.45% of
                    the population identified themselves as ethnic Lithuanians, 6.74% as Poles, 6.31% as Russians, 1.23%
                    as Belarusians, and 2.27% as members of other ethnic groups. Poles in Lithuania are concentrated in
                    the Vilnius Region, allowing Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania, their ethnically-based party,
                    to exert some influence. Russians, however, are relatively evenly spread throughout Lithuania.
                    Lithuanians are usually divided into 5 groups: Samogitians, Sudovians, Aukštaitians, Dzūkians and
                    Lietuvininkai, although the Lietuvinikai are nearly extinct. City dwellers, however, are most often
                    simply called Lithuanians.

                    Lithuania's ethnic composition has undergone significant changes throughout history. The most
                    significant one of these was the extermination of Jews during the Holocaust. Before World War II,
                    approximately 7.5% of Lithuanians were Jewish, referred to as Litvaks. The population of Vilnius was
                    30% Jewish. Almost all of Lithuania's Jews either were killed by Nazi Germany or emigrated, and the
                    2001 census only counted 4007 Jews.

                <h2>Language</h2>

                <p>
                    Lithuanian is the official language of Lithuania. Lithuanian, an Indo-European language, closely
                    resembles ancient Sanskrit, and is written using the Latin alphabet. It is considered by scholars
                    that the Lithuanian language retained, with the fewest changes, most of the elements of
                    Proto-Indo-European language.[5] Various dialects of Lithuanian exist, such as High Lithuanian
                    (Aukštaitian) and Low Lithuanian (Samogitian).[6]

                    During the Lithuanian press ban (1864–1904), Lithuanian was censored by the Russians, and could only
                    be written with the Cyrillic alphabet. Literature in the Lithuanian alphabet was burned and
                    forbidden from publication. Schools, churches, courts, and newspapers faced heavy penalties if Latin
                    text were to be displayed during these years, with violators even exiled to Siberia.[7]

                <h2>Religion</h2>

                <p>
                    Since the Christianization of parts of Lithuania proper in 1387 and of Samogitia in 1413, the
                    majority of Lithuanians have been members of the Roman Catholic Church. According to the 2001
                    census, 79% of Lithuanians are Roman Catholic. Approximately 4.9% of the population are Eastern
                    Orthodox, mainly the Russian minority. Under Article 26 of the Constitution of Lithuania, persons
                    can freely practice a religion of their choosing.

                    Catholicism played a significant role in Lithuanian anti-communist resistance under the Soviet
                    Union. Several Catholic priests were leaders of the anti-communist movements, and thousands of Latin
                    rite crosses were placed on the Hill of Crosses near Šiauliai, despite its being bulldozed in 1961.

                <h2>Education</h2>

                <p>
                    Education in Lithuania exists from pre-school to adult education. Colleges and universities in
                    Lithuania have undergraduate and higher education. Pre-school is for children aged three to six
                    years. After pre-school, children enroll in primary school from seven to ten years of age. At
                    eleven, students begin secondary school until the age of 18. Once the general education is
                    completed, students go to college or university. Students can take the UK exam to study overseas. A
                    bachelor's degree takes four years, traditionally, to complete. A master's takes one to two years to
                    complete; and a doctoral degree takes four years. Lithuania's oldest university is Vilnius
                    University, which was founded in 1579.

                <h2>Art and museums</h2>

                <p>
                    Lithuania's art community is famous for Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis (1875–1911). Čiurlionis
                    was a nationally renowned musician and artist in Lithuania. His symphonic compositions, Jūra ("The
                    sea") and Miške ("In the forest"), were the first full length pieces from a Lithuanian musician.
                    Jūra ("The sea") and Miške ("In the forest") were composed to represent Lithuania's landscape.[14]
                    After Čiurlionis's death, the 2420 Čiurlionis asteroid honors his achievements after being
                    discovered in 1975.

                    A large number of museums exist in Lithuania. The Lithuanian Art Museum was founded in 1933 and is
                    the largest museum of art preservation and display in Lithuania.[15] The Palanga Amber Museum is a
                    subsidiary of the Lithuanian Art Museum. Various amber pieces comprise a major part of the museum.
                    In total, 28,000 pieces of amber are displayed, and about 15,000 contain inclusions of insects,
                    spiders, or plants.[16] Some 4,500 amber pieces in the museum are used for artwork and jewelry.[17]

                    The Lithuanian Museum of Ancient Beekeeping displays various forms of bee hives. The Grūtas Park
                    contains Soviet-era relics and statues including those of Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin.

                <h2>Music</h2>

                <p>
                    Lithuania has a long history of folk, popular and classical musical development. Lithuanian folk
                    music is based primarily around polyphonic music played on flutes, zithers (kanklės) and other
                    instruments.

                <p>
                    Lithuanian folk music is based around songs (dainos), which include romantic, wedding songs, as well
                    as work songs and more archaic war songs. Traditional vocal music is held in high esteem on a world
                    scale: Lithuanian song fests and sutartinės multipart songs are on the UNESCO's representative list
                    of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. Folk songs were performed
                    either in groups or alone, and in parallel chords or unison. Duophonic songs are common in the
                    renowned sutartinės tradition of Aukštaitija. Another style of Lithuanian folk music is called
                    rateliai, a kind of round dance. Instrumentation includes kanklės, a kind of zither that accompanies
                    sutartines, rateliai, waltzes, quadrilles and polkas, and fiddles, (including a bass fiddle called
                    the basetle), a kind of whistle called the lumzdelis and, similar in sound to clarinet, birbyne ;
                    recent importations, beginning in the late 19th century, including the concertina, accordion and
                    bandoneon. Sutartinė is accompanied by the skudučiai, a form of panpipes played by a group of
                    people, as well as wooden trumpets (ragai and dandytės). The kanklės is an extremely important folk
                    instrument, which differs in the number of strings and performance techniques across the country.
                    Other traditional instruments include the švilpas (whistle), drums and tabalas (a percussion
                    instrument like a gong), sekminių ragelis (bagpipe) and the pūslinė (a musical bow made from a pig's
                    bladder filled with dried peas).
