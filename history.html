                <h2>Prehistory</h2>

                <p>
                    The first people settled in the territory of Lithuania after the last glacial period in the 10th
                    millennium BC: Kunda, Neman and Narva cultures. They were traveling hunters and did not form stable
                    settlements. In the 8th millennium BC, the climate became much warmer, and forests developed. The
                    inhabitants of what is now Lithuania then travelled less and engaged in local hunting, gathering and
                    fresh-water fishing. Agriculture did not emerge until the 3rd millennium BC due to a harsh climate
                    and terrain and a lack of suitable tools to cultivate the land. Crafts and trade also started to
                    form at this time. Over a millennium, the Indo-Europeans, who arrived in the 3rd – 2nd millennium
                    BC, mixed with the local population and formed various Baltic tribes.

                    The Baltic tribes did not maintain close cultural or political contacts with the Roman Empire, but
                    they did maintain trade contacts (see Amber Road). Tacitus, in his study Germania, described the
                    Aesti people, inhabitants of the south-eastern Baltic Sea shores who were probably Balts, around the
                    year 97 AD. The Western Balts differentiated and became known to outside chroniclers first. Ptolemy
                    in the 2nd century AD knew of the Galindians and Yotvingians, and early medieval chroniclers
                    mentioned Old Prussians, Curonians and Semigallians.

                    The Lithuanian language is considered to be very conservative for its close connection to
                    Indo-European roots. It is believed to have differentiated from the Latvian language, the most
                    closely related existing language, around the 7th century.[28] Traditional Lithuanian pagan customs
                    and mythology, with many archaic elements, were long preserved. Rulers' bodies were cremated up
                    until the conversion to Christianity: the descriptions of the cremation ceremonies of the grand
                    dukes Algirdas and Kęstutis have survived.

                <h2>Grand Duchy of Lithuania</h2>

                <img class="imi" src="http://www.baltai.lt/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/146858.jpg" alt="prehist">

                <p>
                    From the 9th to the 11th centuries, coastal Balts were subjected to raids by the Vikings, and the
                    kings of Denmark collected tribute at times. During the 10–11th centuries, Lithuanian territories
                    were among the lands paying tribute to Kievan Rus', and Yaroslav the Wise was among the Ruthenian
                    rulers who invaded Lithuania (from 1040). From the mid-12th century, it was the Lithuanians who were
                    invading Ruthenian territories. In 1183, Polotsk and Pskov were ravaged, and even the distant and
                    powerful Novgorod Republic was repeatedly threatened by the excursions from the emerging Lithuanian
                    war machine toward the end of the 12th century.

                    From the late 12th century, an organized Lithuanian military force existed; it was used for external
                    raids, plundering and the gathering of slaves. Such military and pecuniary activities fostered
                    social differentiation and triggered a struggle for power in Lithuania. This initiated the formation
                    of early statehood, from which the Grand Duchy of Lithuania developed.

                    Initially inhabited by fragmented Baltic tribes, in the 1230s the Lithuanian lands were united by
                    Mindaugas, who was crowned as King of Lithuania on 6 July 1253. After his assassination in 1263,
                    pagan Lithuania was a target of the Christian crusades of the Teutonic Knights and the Livonian
                    Order. Siege of Pilėnai is noted for the Lithuanians' defense against the intruders. Despite the
                    devastating century-long struggle with the Orders, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania expanded rapidly,
                    overtaking former Ruthenian principalities of Kievan Rus'.

                    On 22 September 1236, the Battle of Saulė between Samogitians and the Livonian Brothers of the Sword
                    took place close to Šiauliai. The Livonian Brothers were defeated during it and their further
                    conquest of the Balts lands were stopped. The battle inspired rebellions among the Curonians,
                    Semigallians, Selonians, Oeselians, tribes previously conquered by the Sword-Brothers. Some thirty
                    years' worth of conquests on the left bank of Daugava were lost. In 2000, the Lithuanian and Latvian
                    parliaments declared 22 September to be the Day of Baltic Unity.

                <p>
                    After two civil wars, Vytautas the Great became the Grand Duke of Lithuania in 1392. During his
                    reign, Lithuania reached the peak of its territorial expansion, centralization of the state began,
                    and the Lithuanian nobility became increasingly prominent in state politics. In the great Battle of
                    the Vorskla River in 1399, the combined forces of Tokhtamysh and Vytautas were defeated by the
                    Mongols. Thanks to close cooperation, the armies of Lithuania and Poland achieved a victory over the
                    Teutonic Knights in 1410 at the Battle of Grunwald, one of the largest battles of medieval Europe.

                    In January 1429, at the Congress of Lutsk Vytautas received the title of King of Lithuania with the
                    backing of Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, but the envoys who were transporting the crown were
                    stopped by Polish magnates in autumn of 1430. Another crown was sent, but Vytautas died in the
                    Trakai Island Castle several days before it reached Lithuania. He was buried in the Cathedral of
                    Vilnius.

                    After the deaths of Jogaila and Vytautas, the Lithuanian nobility attempted to break the union
                    between Poland and Lithuania, independently selecting Grand Dukes from the Jagiellon dynasty. But,
                    at the end of the 15th century, Lithuania was forced to seek a closer alliance with Poland when the
                    growing power of the Grand Duchy of Moscow threatened Lithuania's Russian principalities and sparked
                    the Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars and the Livonian War.

                <p>
                    On 8 September 1514, Battle of Orsha between Lithuanians, commanded by the Grand Hetman Konstanty
                    Ostrogski, and Muscovites was fought. According to Rerum Moscoviticarum Commentarii by Sigismund von
                    Herberstein, the primary source for information on the battle, the much smaller army of
                    Poland–Lithuania (under 30,000 men) defeated a force of 80,000 Muscovite soldiers, capturing their
                    camp and commander. The battle destroyed a military alliance against Lithuania and Poland. Thousands
                    of Muscovites were captured as prisoners and used as labourers in the Lithuanian manors, while
                    Konstanty Ostrogski delivered the captured Muscovite flags to the Cathedral of Vilnius.

                    The Livonian War was ceased for ten years with a Truce of Yam-Zapolsky signed on 15 January 1582
                    according to which the already Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth recovered Livonia, Polotsk and Velizh,
                    but transferred Velikiye Luki to the Tsardom of Russia. The truce was extended for twenty years in
                    1600, when a diplomatic mission to Moscow led by Lew Sapieha concluded negotiations with Tsar Boris
                    Godunov. The truce was broken when the Poles invaded Muscovy in 1605.

                <h2>Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</h2>

                <p>
                    The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was created in 1569 by the Union of Lublin. As a member of the
                    Commonwealth, Lithuania retained its institutions, including a separate army, currency, and
                    statutory laws – the Statute of Lithuania. Eventually Polonization affected all aspects of
                    Lithuanian life: politics, language, culture, and national identity. From the mid-16th to the
                    mid-17th centuries, culture, arts, and education flourished, fueled by the Renaissance and the
                    Protestant Reformation. From 1573, the Kings of Poland and Grand Dukes of Lithuania were elected by
                    the nobility, who were granted ever increasing Golden Liberties. These liberties, especially the
                    liberum veto, led to anarchy and the eventual dissolution of the state.
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    The Commonwealth reached its Golden Age in the early 17th century. Its powerful parliament was
                    dominated by nobles who were reluctant to get involved in the Thirty Years' War; this neutrality
                    spared the country from the ravages of a political-religious conflict that devastated most of
                    contemporary Europe. The Commonwealth held its own against Sweden, the Tsardom of Russia, and
                    vassals of the Ottoman Empire, and even launched successful expansionist offensives against its
                    neighbours. In several invasions during the Time of Troubles, Commonwealth troops entered Russia and
                    managed to take Moscow and hold it from 27 September 1610 to 4 November 1612, when they were driven
                    out after a siege.

                <p>
                    In 1655, after the extinguishing battle, for the first time in history Lithuanian capital Vilnius
                    was taken by the foreign army. Russian army looted the city, splendid churches, manors. 8000-10000
                    citizens were killed; the city burned 17 days. Those who returned after the catastrophe didn't
                    recognise the city. Russian occupation of Grand Duchy of Lithuania lasted up to 1661. Many artefacts
                    and cultural heritage were either lost or looted, significant parts of the state archive –
                    Lithuanian Metrica, collected since the 13th century, were lost and the rest is moved out of the
                    country. During the Northern Wars (1655–1661), the Lithuanian territory and economy were devastated
                    by the Swedish army. Almost all territory of Grand Duchy of Lithuania was occupied by Swedish and
                    Russian armies. This period is known as Tvanas (The Deluge).
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    Before it could fully recover, Lithuania was ravaged during the Great Northern War (1700–1721). The
                    war, a plague, and a famine caused the deaths of approximately 40% of the country's population.
                    Foreign powers, especially Russia, became dominant in the domestic politics of the Commonwealth.
                    Numerous fractions among the nobility used the Golden Liberties to prevent any reforms.

                    The Constitution of 3 May 1791 was adopted by the Great Sejm (parliament) of the Polish–Lithuanian
                    Commonwealth trying to save the state. The legislation was designed to redress the Commonwealth's
                    political defects due to the system of Golden Liberties, also known as the "Nobles' Democracy," had
                    conferred disproportionate rights on the nobility (szlachta) and over time had corrupted politics.
                    The constitution sought to supplant the prevailing anarchy fostered by some of the country's
                    magnates with a more democratic constitutional monarchy. It introduced elements of political
                    equality between townspeople and nobility, and placed the peasants under the protection of the
                    government, thus mitigating the worst abuses of serfdom. It banned parliamentary institutions such
                    as the liberum veto, which had put the Sejm at the mercy of any deputy who could revoke all the
                    legislation that had been passed by that Sejm. It was drafted in relation to a copy of the United
                    States Constitution. Others have called it the world's second-oldest codified national governmental
                    constitution after the 1787 U.S. Constitution.
